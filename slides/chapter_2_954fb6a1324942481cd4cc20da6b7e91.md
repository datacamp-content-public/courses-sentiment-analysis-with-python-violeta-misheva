## Survival analysis: What?

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 477bbb9a84
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
> 
**The time it takes for an event of interest to occur.**


`@script`
So far, we learned what is survival (also called duration) analysis. We defined it as ‘the time it takes for an event of interest to occur’. 

We talked about where it’s used and demonstrated that with varied data sets in the exercises.

## Survival Analysis: Where

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: ee265d94d9
```

`@part1`
- Medical studies: time to death, disease(recovery) {{1}}
- Engineering: time to failure {{2}}
- HR: to model absenteeism, employee turnover{{3}}
- Client applications and product analytics: churn{{4}}
- Political science: model political regimes{{5}}
- Real estate: time to sale/rent of a property{{6}}

`@script`
Concretely, survival analysis is quite common in medical studies where we may want to study the time to death, disease or to disease recovery; 

It is widespread in other areas, such as engineering where we may look at ‘time to failure’, 

HR where we can model absenteeism, or predict when an employee may leave a company, 

in any client facing application or product analytics where we may want to predict when a client is likely to churn; 

political science to analyze the end of a political regime, 

real estate to predict time to sale or renting of a property 

and others.
